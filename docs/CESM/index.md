# CESM

This overview goes through how to [install](./installation.md) CESM version 2.1.3 on Archer2, before outlining the 
[basics](./basics.md) of CESM and how to [run a simple simulation](./first_run.md).

There is a [tutorial](https://ncar.github.io/CESM-Tutorial/README.html) 
which much of this is based on, and provides a lot further information.
