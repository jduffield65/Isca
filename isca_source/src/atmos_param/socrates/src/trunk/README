0) BSD 3-Clause licence
-----------------------

For further details please refer to the file COPYRIGHT.txt
which you should have received as part of this distribution.


1) What's included?
-------------------

You should have received this package as a tar file containing the
directories: src/ make/ data/ examples/ idl/ python/ man/ sbin/ docs/

src/ contains the source code in Fortran 95 (.f90) and a few remaining 
in Fortran 77 (.f).

make/ contains the Makefile which then accesses the various Mk_*
files.

sbin/ contains scripts that can be used to run the fortran routines.

man/ contains man pages for scripts in sbin/. For example, running
'man Cl_run_cdf' will give options for that script. 

examples/ and data/ provide test input for the radiation code. 
See the CONTENTS in each directory under examples/ for instructions.

idl/ and python/ contain scripts to generate atmospheric profiles etc
in netCDF format to be used as input for the radiation code (l_run_cdf).

docs/ contain the user guide and technical guide for the ES code.


2) Compiling the source code within the Met Office
--------------------------------------------------

For users within the Met Office simply run the command:

./build_code

to compile the entire suite. To setup your path to the executables
and man pages you should then source the following file:

. ./set_rad_env

Individual programs can also be compiled using the build_code script
(build_code will take as an argument the target to pass to the makefile).

For example, to build the routines that don't require netCDF:

./build_code cdl

To build just the two-stream/radiance code (netCDF version):

./build_code l_run_cdf


3) Compiling the source code externally
---------------------------------------

For external users it should only be necessary to edit the file
make/Mk_cmd to allow compilation of the code on your system. FORTCOMP
and LINK can be changed to your local Fortran compiler. To use the netCDF
routines you must also change INCCDF_PATH and LIBCDF_PATH to point to
your local netCDF installation.

The following commands can then be run to build the suite and setup
your path to the executables and man pages:

./build_code
. ./set_rad_env

See section 2 for building individual routines.


4) Compilation of scripts in sbin
---------------------------------

There are a small number of utilities in sbin/ which are written 
in C and require compilation. A Makefile has been provided:

cd $RAD_SCRIPT
make


5) Running the code
-------------------

Once you have set your path to the man pages (see section 2/3) you can 
find up-to-date instructions for running the following routines:

Two-stream and spherical harmonics radiance codes using netCDF or
text CDL input files:

man Cl_run_cdf
man Cl_run_cdl

A Mie scattering code for determining optical properties of aerosol
and cloud particles:

man Cscatter

A correlated-k code for the calculation of gaseous absorption 
coefficients for the spectral files either directly from HITRAN
.par or .xsc databases or line-by-line absorption coefficients in
a netCDF input file:

man Ccorr_k

Auxillary routines for format conversion, interpolation etc:

man Ccdf2cdl
man Ccdl2cdf
man Cinterp

These scripts are a command line interface to interactive routines in
the bin/ directory. These routines may be run directly if desired (eg.
l_run_cdf).

It is very useful to study the examples/ directory for common usage
of the code.


6) Tested compilers
-------------------

The full suite has been tested with the following compilers:

Intel ifort 17.0.7
GCC gfortran 8.1.0

To use these compilers within the Met Office run, respectively:
./build_code ifort
./build_code gfortran
